# 📊 How Spread Out Is Your Data?

We often focus on averages, but understanding how data varies is just as crucial—especially in fields like finance, education, and operations.

This post is part of my **Beyond the Numbers** series where I simplify statistical concepts using real-world examples and clear R code.

## In today’s slide, I explore:

- ✅ **Variance**  
- ✅ **Standard Deviation**  
- ✅ **Range**  
- ✅ **Interquartile Range (IQR)**  

...with an engaging **courier delivery case study** and **boxplot visualization**.
